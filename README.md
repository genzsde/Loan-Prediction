# Loan Prediction

From the challange hosted at: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/
## Problem Statement:

Green Energy Solutions is a company that provides financing for solar energy installations. They operate in urban, suburban, and rural areas. Customers first apply for a solar installation loan, after which the company assesses the customerâ€™s eligibility for the loan.

The company aims to automate the solar loan eligibility process (in real-time) based on customer details provided during the online application process. These details include Age, Occupation, Residence Type, Household Income, Loan Amount Requested, Credit Score, and Solar Installation Type. To streamline this process, they have posed a problem to identify the customer segments that are eligible for the loan, enabling them to target these specific segments effectively. Here, they have supplied a partial data set for this purpose.
